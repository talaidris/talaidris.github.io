                <p>This course has been very interesting so far! Im happy with the updated design of my portfolio. I
                    could add more design/aesthetic aspects to the web site in the future. I feel pretty comfortable
                    with designing web pages now. Im hoping to learn how to make my web pages more interactive!

                <h3>February 3 2025:</h3>
                <p>My experience with client-side JavaScript programming has been pretty good so far! It has not been
                    hard to leverage my past programming experience.One of the more interesting things ive learned about
                    JS is the many different uses of anonymous functions. I have found that getting used to the syntax
                    of JS has been a bit challlenging.
